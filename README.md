This reposititary contains R Markdown source files for some of my slides. 

My slides are made using the `xaringan` R package but I don't recommend you study these if you are trying to learn `xaringan`. I am experimenting with certain components and it differs signficantly from standard usage of xaringan. (Feel free to talk to me about it if you want to know more).

You can find most of my slides [here](https://emitanaka.github.io/#talks).
